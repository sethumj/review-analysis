# review-analysis
Problem: App developers need a way to easily and quickly understand the sentiment of user reviews for their apps.

Solution: This project will develop a machine learning model to classify app reviews into three categories: positive, negative, and bug reports.

Approach: The model will be trained on a dataset of app reviews that have been manually labeled by human experts. The model will use a variety of machine learning techniques, including decision trees, clustering, and transformer models.

Benefits: The model will be able to provide app developers with insights into how users are feeling about their apps. This information can be used to improve the apps and make them more user-friendly.
